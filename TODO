 - check possible memory leaks.
 - reduce C++ containers impact by executing out queries as soon as they are parsed. 

Both:
unimplemented gather/rewrite for other functions, search through cdb_rewrite.cc

* Make sure that constant expressions in queries (e.g., SELECT "mysecret";)
  are encrypted with RND, even if it's some temporary key that does not
  correspond to any column.

* Get database name through lex instead of parsing it again in Rewriter::rewrite.
