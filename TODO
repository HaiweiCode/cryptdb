wiki -- host it on git?

Carlos:
doxygen


Both immediate future:
unimplemented gather/rewrite for other functions, search through cdb_rewrite.cc
left join, right join
start looking into sql.mit.edu trace
tests for combination of encrypted and unencrypted data
date
decimal
data loading

Raluca:
CryptoHandlers [done]
partition cdb_rewrite.cc

* Make sure that constant expressions in queries (e.g., SELECT "mysecret";)
  are encrypted with RND, even if it's some temporary key that does not
  correspond to any column.

* Get database name through lex instead of parsing it again in Rewriter::rewrite.
