TRANSACT on stale onions after UPDATE
 - Support multiple tables.
ALTER TABLE
 - FOREIGN KEY
 - ADD INDEX
 - DROP INDEX
 - RENAME
 - CHANGE COLUMN
Subqueries
DECIMAL
VARCHAR
Misc Bugs
    * Connect can get into an inconsistent state because it claims to know
    the current database (getCurDBName), but a rogue USE statement will
    make it a liar.
    * Crash while displaying encrypted query (executeQuery)
      > CREATE TABLE t (x integer, y varchar(100), z integer);
      > INSERT INTO t values (1, 'alice', NULL);
      # Crash doesn't happen if we build another table first.
    * ALTER TABLE ... occasionally locks in
      mysql_execute_query => pthread_cond_timedwait
Finish removing MultiPrincipal code.
 - Test stuff.
 - Rewriter constructor.


Carlos:
Import tool notes:
    1 - The following strings (queries) are valid in MYSQL >= 3.23.12:
        /*!40000 ALTER TABLE `t1` ENABLE KEYS */;
        CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/ `cryptdbtest_control` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 */;
        /*!40101 SET @saved_cs_client     = @@character_set_client */;
        /*!40000 ALTER TABLE `columns_priv` DISABLE KEYS */;

    Queries enclosed by "/*!" and "*/" indicate MySQL server that commands in between must _not_ be executed in versions
    prior to 3.23.12, in our MySQL Server (5.5.14) when such commands are present they are supposed to be execute:
    
    In MySQL > 3.23.12 they are converted:
    
    from:
         /*!40101 SET @saved_cs_client     = @@character_set_client */;
    to:
        SET @saved_cs_client     = @@character_set_client;

        *ps: above queries are running OK. To do more tests before removing this item.

    It is possible to run a script against the dump file and eliminate such 
    identifiers in advance, but the best scenario is to support as is.

    2 - Some queries are failing, at least in my environment, they are:
        - CREATE DATABASE
        - LOCK
        - UNLOCK
        - maybe others..

        MySQL dump file usually include these queries, one or another may be included or excluded manually by mysqldump, somehow,
        but in general CryptDB should support the whole set otherwise importing databases wouldn't be much feasible in real scenarios. 
 
    3 - New import tool version.
        - Took the wrong path and much some time trying to use XML database dump format, not feasible, complex and error prone,
        switched to plain (default) dump file format and parser took less than 20 lines of code, very simple. 


    4. Testing:
      -- make old tests work again
      -- test aliases
      -- join
      -- update + increment
      (by Wed)
      -- soon: decimal, varchar, char[lengths], (should be ready by Wed)
      

Raluca:
by monday: finish reorganizing crypto handlers to allow different data types like varchar
+ bug in loading tool
by tue: decimal

Aaron:
tue: put proxy back, rewriter not execute onion lowering any more, but just return as list of queries




All: Thur - Sun:
work on proxy, concurrency, connections 
testing
wed: timestamp and date

All:
Monday 15 start on sql.mit.edu
proxy back up and setup for sql.mit.edu





* Make sure that constant expressions in queries (e.g., SELECT "mysecret";)
  are encrypted with RND, even if it's some temporary key that does not
  correspond to any column.

* Get database name through lex instead of parsing it again in Rewriter::rewrite.
