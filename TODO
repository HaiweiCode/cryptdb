TRANSACT on stale onions after UPDATE
 - Support multiple tables.

 - FOREIGN KEY
 - ADD INDEX
 - DROP INDEX
 - RENAME
 - CHANGE COLUMN
Subqueries
DECIMAL
VARCHAR
Misc Bugs
    * Connect can get into an inconsistent state because it claims to know
    the current database (getCurDBName), but a rogue USE statement will
    make it a liar.
    * Crash while displaying encrypted query (executeQuery)
      > CREATE TABLE t (x integer, y varchar(100), z integer);
      > INSERT INTO t values (1, 'alice', NULL);
      # Crash doesn't happen if we build another table first.


Carlos:
Import tool fixes:
 - fix query syntax errors.
 - use lex or XML parser to parse _all_ fields insteand of doing it myself.
 - check possible memory leaks.
 - reduce C++ containers impact by executing out queries as soon as they are parsed. 

Both:
unimplemented gather/rewrite for other functions, search through cdb_rewrite.cc
date

--------------

Raluca:
partition cdb_rewrite.cc
by monday: finish reorganizing crypto handlers to allow different data types like decimal, varchar


Raluca & Aaron:
tue: deicmal + varchar
wed: timestamp and date

Thur - Sun:
work on proxy, concurrency, connections 

All:
Monday 15 start on sql.mit.edu






* Make sure that constant expressions in queries (e.g., SELECT "mysecret";)
  are encrypted with RND, even if it's some temporary key that does not
  correspond to any column.

* Get database name through lex instead of parsing it again in Rewriter::rewrite.
